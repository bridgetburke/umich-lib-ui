# Documentation Site

## Docs

All of the docs live in the `docs` in the root of this repository. They are in Markdown and they should include the following frontmatter at the top of each file that specifies the title for the page.

```md
---
title: "Some Title"
---
```

## Development

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then run from this `site` directory:
```sh
gatsby develop
```
